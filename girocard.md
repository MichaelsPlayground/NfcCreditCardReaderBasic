# reading a (German) GiroCard

A **GiroCard** is issued by German banks and can be used locally in shops or at ATMs. As most banks 
work together with Credit Card issuers most cards do have an additional application on the card 
that enabled them for usage in other European countries for shopping and ATM usage.

The cooperation's between the banks and MasterCard ("Maestro") and Visa ("VPay") will stop in the 
next years as MasterCard announced to stop the Maestro service in the next years and probably Visa 
will follow.

A GiroCard is always a **Debit card** and the **PAN** is not the real account number for debiting 
but  combination of a "Bank number" and a part of the account number, so don't use this "PAN" for 
any real bank transaction.

In this document I'm showing the steps to read the PAN and Expiration date of the card by showing
the commands and responses for each step, a more generalized information is available in the
[readme](readme.md) document.
