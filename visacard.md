# Reading a VisaCard

A **VisaCard** is issued by a bank under the licence of Visa. The are three flavours of cards
available on the market: the classic **Credit card**, the **Debit card** and sometimes **Prepaid cards**.

The PAN on the chip may differ from the PAN printed on the card for some internal reasons.

In this document I'm showing the steps to read the PAN and Expiration date of the card by showing 
the commands and responses for each step, a more generalized information is available in the 
[readme](readme.md) document.

A general notice: I could test my program only with the cards I'm obtaining so it might be that your 
card can't get read because of different tags or templates used on your card. If you give me the commands 
and responses up to the point where the reading of your card is failing I'm trying to help you - 
just open an issue and copy & paste the data from the export file, thank you.

**Warning: the usage of this program reveals secret information from your Credit Card.** 
This program does not send the data anywhere but when exporting the mail and/or the file 
contain these informations. So please be very careful when sending those data using unsecured 
media like Email or simple internet uploading !

In this workflow I'm using a **VisaCard from Lloyds Bank** that was cancelled some months ago so the PAN and 
other data shown here not from an active card.

## step 1: read the main directory using the SELECT PPSE command

```plaintext
01 select PPSE command length 20 data: 00a404000e325041592e5359532e444446303100
01 select PPSE response length 47 data: 6f2b840e325041592e5359532e4444463031a519bf0c1661144f07a00000000310109f0a080001050100000000

                                 A0 00 00 00 03 10 10 (BINARY)
                           9F 0A 08 -- [UNKNOWN TAG]
                                    00 01 05 01 00 00 00 00 (BINARY)
------------------------------------
```
## step 2: analyze the SELECT PPSE response

We are searching for one or more tags **0x4f** that represents the **Application Identifier (AID)**. 
Here we found one AID (A0000000031010), searching in an online directory (see link below) shows it is a VisaCard: 
*VISA Debit/Credit (Classic)*.

```plaintext
4F 07 -- Application Identifier (AID) - card
      A0 00 00 00 03 10 10 (BINARY)
```

## step 3: select an application on the card

The AID we found ist used for the next step - we are selecting this AID and with this step we are unlocking the card 
for further readings. This important because skipping this step may end in failures when reading data from the card.

```plaintext
03 select AID command length 13 data: 00a4040007a000000003101000
03 select AID response length 95 data: 6f5d8407a0000000031010a5525010564953412044454249542020202020208701029f38189f66049f02069f03069f1a0295055f2a029a039c019f37045f2d02656ebf0c1a9f5a0531082608269f0a080001050100000000bf6304df200180

                                       80 (BINARY)
------------------------------------
```

## step 4: search for tag 0x9F38 in the response from step 3

We are searching for the tag **0x9f38** that represents the **Processing Options Data Object List (PDOL)**. This is the result:

```plaintext:
9F 38 18 -- Processing Options Data Object List (PDOL)
         9F 66 04 -- Terminal Transaction Qualifiers
         9F 02 06 -- Amount, Authorised (Numeric)
         9F 03 06 -- Amount, Other (Numeric)
         9F 1A 02 -- Terminal Country Code
         95 05 -- Terminal Verification Results (TVR)
         5F 2A 02 -- Transaction Currency Code
         9A 03 -- Transaction Date
         9C 01 -- Transaction Type
         9F 37 04 -- Unpredictable Number
```

Don't get confused about the kind of data requested: usually the card is used in a payment terminal for paying 
goods, restaurant bills or getting cash at the ATM so the data is part of the transaction initiating.

The card requests these data for the next step and we do need to provide the data in the length that is given in the 
last byte of the each subtag. Here are two examples:

The card is asking for "Terminal Transaction Qualifiers" (tag 0x9f66) and the length has to be 4 bytes long ("04"):
```plaintext
9F 66 04 -- Terminal Transaction Qualifiers
```

The card is asking for the "Transaction Date" (tag 9a) that has to by 3 bytes long ("03"):
```plaintext
9A 03 -- Transaction Date
```

When adding all length information's (4+6+..+1+4) we get a **total length of 33 bytes** that has to be returned to the card.

Unfortunately we now have to examine each tag and find useful data to provide. The transaction date e.g. needs to be a 
date in the format YYMMDD (byte array in hex string encoding). Luckily most of the data fields can be zeroed so there is 
not much work to do but - so data fields need to have "accepted" data.

For this purpose I'm using a lookup class were some tags are stored with a working dataset 
(DolValues.java class in nfccreditcards package), e.g.:
```plaintext
tag 0x9f66 Terminal Transaction Qualifiers: A0 00 00 00
tag 0x9f1a Terminal Country Code: 09 78
...
```

Note: each card issuer can request an individual set of tags so it is possible that your card is requesting some "exotic" data.

## step 5: build a Get Procession Option command

The PDOL data are embedded in a command and here are all data elements in one row: `a00000000000000010000000000000000978000000000009782303010038393031`. 
This string is 66 characters long, after conversion to a byte array the length is 33 byte - that is the sum of all tags requested by the card in step 

**Warning**: this step may reveal confidential data like the PAN/CreditCard number - be extreme cautious when publishing or posting or sending the response over 
an unsecure channel like Email !**

```plaintext
05 get the processing options command length: 41 data: 80a80000238321a0000000000000001000000000000000097800000000000978230301003839303100

               20 70 00 00 (BINARY)
------------------------------------
```

## step 6: analyze the Get Processing Option response


```plaintext
found tag 0x57 = Track 2 Equivalent Data


*********************************
************ step  7 ************
* print PAN & expire date       *
*********************************
07 get PAN and Expiration date from tag 0x57 (Track 2 Equivalent Data)
