# reading a MasterCard

A **MasterCard** is issued by a bank under the licence of MasterCard. The are three flavours of cards 
available on the market: the classic **Credit card**, the **Debit card** and sometimes **Prepaid cards**.

The PAN on the chip may differ from the PAN printed on the card for some internal reasons.

In this document I'm showing the steps to read the PAN and Expiration date of the card by showing
the commands and responses for each step, a more generalized information is available in the
[readme](readme.md) document.
