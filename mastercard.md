# Reading a MasterCard

A **MasterCard** is issued by a bank under the licence of MasterCard. The are three flavours of cards 
available on the market: the classic **Credit card**, the **Debit card** and sometimes **Prepaid cards**.

The PAN on the chip may differ from the PAN printed on the card for some internal reasons.

In this document I'm showing the steps to read the PAN and Expiration date of the card by showing
the commands and responses for each step, a more generalized information is available in the
[readme](readme.md) document.

A general notice: I could test my program only with the cards I'm obtaining so it might be that your
card can't get read because of different tags or templates used on your card. If you give me the commands
and responses up to the point where the reading of your card is failing I'm trying to help you -
just open an issue and copy & paste the data from the export file, thank you.

**Warning: the usage of this program reveals secret information from your Credit Card.**
This program does not send the data anywhere but when exporting the mail and/or the file
contain these informations. So please be very careful when sending those data using unsecured
media like Email or simple internet uploading !
